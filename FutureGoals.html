	<h2> Future Plans! </h3>
	 <ul>
	 	In the summer of 2025, we are swimming the Catalina Channel with swimmers: Owen, Dagny, Berlyn, Esme, Nina, and Timothy! It is a 21 mile overnight swim that we plan on completing in July. Filled with bioluminescence and dolphins, the Catalina Channel is a great swim to complete as the 2nd swim in the seven seas we plan on crossing.
