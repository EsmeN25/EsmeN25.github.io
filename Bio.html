	<h2>All About Us!</h2>
	<a href="index.html"> home</a>
	<ul>
		<li> KeckCrewSF was started during covid in 2020 by Mike Keck, a swim coach at the Olympic Club and Mike Tschan-Hanz from the Bay Club. We swim in the San Francisco Bay and Paradise Beach Park in Tiburon. We are a strong suppoter of the SwimAcrossAmerica foundation and annually participate in the swims to fight cancer. Over the years we have succesfully completed many swims across the globe and are striving for more successful relays in the coming years!
